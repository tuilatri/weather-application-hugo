# Building an Interactive Weather Application

### Overview

In this workshop, you will be guided step-by-step to build a complete and highly interactive weather application. The project uses JavaScript for the frontend to handle the user interface and interactions, along with a simple Node.js (Express) backend to securely communicate with an external weather API.

### Key Project Features

‚ÑπÔ∏è This application not only displays basic weather information but also integrates many advanced features to provide the best user experience.

üí° **Highlight Features:**

*   **Detailed Weather Display:** Provides current weather information and a forecast for the next 7 days.
*   **Smart Search:** Automatically suggests locations as the user types.
*   **Geolocation:** Automatically fetches weather data based on the user's current location.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Supports over 40 different languages, allowing users to choose their preferred display language.
*   **Save Favorite Locations:** Uses `localStorage` to save locations that the user is interested in.
*   **Unit Conversion:** Easily switch the temperature between Celsius (¬∞C) and Fahrenheit (¬∞F).
*   **Advanced Metrics:** Displays important indices such as Air Quality (AQI), UV index, and chance of rain.
*   **Dynamic UI:** Features randomly changing backgrounds and applies smooth transition effects.

### Architecture and Scope

‚ÑπÔ∏è The project is divided into two main parts: the **Frontend** (client-side) and the **Backend** (server-side), which communicate with each other via an API.

**Frontend (Client-side)**

*   Responsible for displaying the entire user interface and handling interactions.
*   **`main.js`**: The central file, managing the main flow and events (search, language selection, saving locations).
*   **`ui.js`**: Manages updating and displaying data on the DOM (Document Object Model), including the loading skeleton effect.
*   **`api.js`**: Sends `fetch` requests to the backend to get weather data and search suggestions.
*   **`lang.js`**: Contains translation data and the logic to update static text according to the selected language.
*   **`favorites.js`**: Provides functions to manage the list of favorite locations in `localStorage`.
*   **`clock.js`**: Logic for both the analog and digital clocks displayed on the interface.
*   **`animations.js`**: Contains functions for creating effects (e.g., the number counting animation for the temperature).

üîí **Backend (Server-side)**

*   Acts as a secure proxy layer between the frontend and the WeatherAPI.
*   **`server.js`**: Built with Node.js and Express, it creates endpoints for the frontend to call.
    *   `/weather`: Receives requests from the frontend, then calls the WeatherAPI with the API key secured on the server to fetch weather data.
    *   `/search`: Receives search requests, then calls the WeatherAPI to get a list of suggestions.
