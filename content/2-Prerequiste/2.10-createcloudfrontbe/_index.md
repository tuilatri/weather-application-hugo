### Create a CloudFront Distribution for the Backend

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   **Amazon CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) service that speeds up the distribution of web content (like APIs, videos, and data) to end-users with low latency and high transfer speeds.
*   In this architecture, CloudFront will serve as the public "gateway" for our backend API, instead of accessing the ALB directly.
*   **Key Benefits:**
    *   **HTTPS Termination:** CloudFront will handle the HTTPS connection from the user. It will then communicate with the ALB over HTTP within AWS's internal network. This simplifies SSL/TLS management, as we don't need to configure certificates on the ALB or EC2 instances.
    *   **Increased Performance and Reduced Latency:** CloudFront brings your API closer to users through its global network of edge locations.
    *   **Enhanced Security:** It provides an additional layer of protection, masking the ALB, and can be integrated with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall).

üîí **Execution Steps**

#### **1. Start Creating the Distribution**

*   From the **AWS Management Console**, search for and select the **CloudFront** service.
*   Click on **Create a CloudFront distribution**.

#### **2. Configure the Origin**

*   **Origin domain:** Click the field and select the DNS name of the Application Load Balancer `project-backend-alb` from the dropdown list.
*   **Protocol:** Select `HTTP only`.
*   **HTTP port:** Leave the default as `80`.

#### **3. Configure Default Cache Behavior**

*   This is the most critical configuration part to ensure the API works correctly.
*   **Viewer protocol policy:** Select `Redirect HTTP to HTTPS` to automatically redirect users to a secure connection.
*   **Allowed HTTP methods:** Select `GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE` to allow all API methods.
*   **Cache policy:** Select `CachingDisabled`. This is crucial because we do not want CloudFront to cache API responses (which are dynamic).
*   **Origin request policy - optional:** Select `AllViewer`. This policy forwards all information from the user (headers, query strings, cookies) to the ALB, ensuring the backend receives all the necessary data to process the request.

#### **4. Configure Other Settings**

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Select `Do not enable security protections` for the purpose of this workshop.

#### **5. Finalize and Test**

*   Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Create distribution**.
*   The process of deploying a new distribution across CloudFront's entire network can take 5 to 15 minutes. You will see the status `Deploying`.

*   When the status changes to `Enabled` (showing the Last modified date), copy the **Distribution domain name** (e.g., `d12345abcdef.cloudfront.net`).

{{< figure src="/images/2.prerequisite/2.10-createcloudfrontbe/cf-copy-domain.png" title="Copying the Distribution's Domain Name" >}}

*   Paste this domain name into your browser. The returned result should be identical to when you accessed it via the ALB's DNS: `Backend is running!`.
