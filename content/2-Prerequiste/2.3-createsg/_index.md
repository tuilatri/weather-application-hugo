### Create Security Groups in Amazon VPC

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Objective**

*   A **Security Group** acts as a virtual firewall at the instance level to control inbound and outbound traffic.
*   In this section, we will create 3 separate Security Groups for each component in our architecture:
    1.  **Bastion Host:** Allows secure SSH access from the outside.
    2.  **Backend:** Receives traffic from the Load Balancer and allows administration from the Bastion Host.
    3.  **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Receives public traffic from users.

---

üîí **Execution Steps**

#### **1. Create Security Group for the Bastion Host (`project-bastion-host-sg`)**

This is the protection layer for the Bastion Host, allowing us to connect to it securely from the Internet.

*   **Step 1: Start Creating the Security Group**
    *   From the **VPC Dashboard**, select **Security Groups** from the left menu.
    *   Click on **Create security group**.

*   **Step 2: Configure Basic Information**
    *   **Security group name:** `project-bastion-host-sg`
    *   **Description:** `Allow access to Bastion Host`
    *   **VPC:** Select the `project-vpc` created in the previous step.

*   **Step 3: Set up Inbound Rules**
    *   Click **Add rule** and configure the following rules:

| Type | Protocol | Port range | Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SSH | TCP | 22 | My IP | Allows you to connect via SSH from your current IP. |
| HTTP | TCP | 80 | Anywhere-IPv4 | Allows HTTP access from anywhere. |
| HTTPS | TCP | 443 | Anywhere-IPv4 | Allows HTTPS access from anywhere. |
| All ICMP-IPv4 | All | All | Anywhere-IPv4 | Allows `ping` to check connectivity. |

*   **Step 4:** Scroll down and click **Create security group**.

---

#### **2. Create Security Group for the Backend (`project-backend-sg`)**

This protection layer only allows access from the Application Load Balancer and the Bastion Host, ensuring the backend servers are not directly accessible from the Internet.

*   **Step 1: Configure Basic Information**
    *   Click **Create security group** again.
    *   **Security group name:** `project-backend-sg`
    *   **Description:** `Allow access from ALB and Bastion Host`
    *   **VPC:** Select the `project-vpc`.

    {{< figure src="/images/2.prerequisite/2.3-createsg/sg-be-des.png" title="Basic information for the Backend SG" >}}

*   **Step 2: Set up Inbound Rules**
    *   Click **Add rule** and configure the following rules:

| Type | Protocol | Port range | Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Custom TCP | TCP | 3000 | Custom -> `project-alb-sg` | Allows the ALB to send traffic to the backend application. |
| SSH | TCP | 22 | Custom -> `project-bastion-host-sg` | Allows SSH connection from the Bastion Host for administration. |
| All ICMP-IPv4 | All | All | Anywhere-IPv4 | Allows `ping` to check connectivity. |

When selecting the **Source**, type `sg-` into the search box, and AWS will display a list of available Security Groups for you to choose from.

*   **Step 3:** Click **Create security group**.

---

#### **3. Create Security Group for the Application Load Balancer (`project-alb-sg`)**

This protection layer allows users from the Internet to access our application through the ALB.

*   **Step 1: Configure Basic Information**
    *   Click **Create security group**.
    *   **Security group name:** `project-alb-sg`
    *   **Description:** `Allow public traffic to ALB`
    *   **VPC:** Select the `project-vpc`.

    {{< figure src="/images/2.prerequisite/2.3-createsg/sg-alb-des.png" title="Basic information for the ALB SG" >}}

*   **Step 2: Set up Inbound Rules**
    *   Click **Add rule** and configure the following rules:

| Type  | Protocol | Port range | Source        | Description |
| :---  | :---     | :---       | :---          | :---        |
| HTTP  | TCP      | 80         | Anywhere-IPv4 | Allows users to access via HTTP. |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443        | Anywhere-IPv4 | Allows users to access via HTTPS. |

    {{< figure src="/images/2.prerequisite/2.3-createsg/sg-alb-ib.png" title="Configuring Inbound Rules for the ALB SG" >}}

*   **Step 3: Set up Outbound Rules**
    *   The ALB needs to send traffic to the backend on port 3000. By default, Outbound Rules allow all traffic out, but for better security, we should restrict this.
    *   Select the **Outbound rules** tab -> **Edit outbound rules**.
    *   Delete the default rule and **Add rule** with the following:

| Type | Protocol | Port range | Destination | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Custom TCP | TCP | 3000 | Custom -> `project-backend-sg` | Allows the ALB to send traffic to the backend servers. |

*   **Step 4:** Click **Save rules**, then click **Create security group**.

After completion, you will have 3 Security Groups ready to be assigned to their corresponding resources.
