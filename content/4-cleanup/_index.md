**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:** This is a mandatory step after you complete the workshop. Failing to clean up resources will cause your AWS account to continue incurring costs, especially for services like NAT Gateway, Application Load Balancer, and EC2.

To ensure nothing is missed, we must delete the resources in the reverse order of their creation.

#### **1. Delete CloudFront Distributions**
You need to delete both distributions created for the Frontend (S3) and Backend (ALB).

*   Select a distribution, click **Disable**, and confirm.
*   After the distribution is disabled, select it again and click **Delete**.

#### **2. Delete the Auto Scaling Group**
This action will also automatically terminate the EC2 instances managed by the ASG.

*   Navigate to the **EC2** service -> **Auto Scaling Groups**.

*   Select `project-backend-target-group`, go to **Actions**, and choose **Delete**.

#### **5. Terminate Remaining EC2 Instances**
Instances not managed by the ASG must be terminated manually.

*   Navigate to **EC2** -> **Instances**.

    *   Select `project-backend-ec2-ami`, go to **Actions**, and choose **Deregister AMI**.
*   **Step 2: Delete the Snapshot**
    *   Navigate to **EC2** -> **Snapshots**.
    *   Find the Snapshot created by the AMI (the description usually contains the AMI ID), select it, and go to **Actions** -> **Delete snapshot**.

#### **8. Delete the S3 Bucket**
You must first delete all objects inside the bucket.

*   Navigate to the **S3** service.

This is the final step, which will delete the VPC and its associated resources like Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway, and most importantly, the **NAT Gateway**.
